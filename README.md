# Kaprekar's Constant
This program uses while loops and list slicing to calculate Kaprekar's Constant.
To calculate Kaprekar's constant, the program loops through all digit order possibilities until the sum is equivalent to 6174 from a four-digit integer input. It sorts the digits to find the difference between descending and ascending values, iterating until reaching 6174 while displaying the sequence of results and the number of iterations.
